			It all started at the age of 6, when my parents first put me through piano lessons. Since then, it seemed like no matter what I did, music was always a part of my life. After 11 years of classical piano lessons, I was awarded the Senior Medallion for achieving Piano Advanced Level of Certificate of Merit through the Music Teacher's Association of California, performed at the annual MTAC convenction recital, and most importantly, developed a love for music that I'll never lose. <br>
			<br>
			I joined my high school choir my second semester junior year, and senior year I was in my school's chamber choir. We competed in Anaheim and won multiple awards, including Best Overall Chamber Choir. The trip to Anaheim was one of my most memorable moments in high school, and the people I competed with are still some of my closest friends to this day. <br>
			<br>
			Since I graduated high school, I haven't had easy access to a piano, but I did have a guitar my friends bought me for me 18th birthday. Thanks to them, I had another outlet for music in college. Although I'm nowhere near as good at guitar as I am at piano, I'm proud to say that I taught myself how to play. I like it so much that my ideal way of relaxing is a quiet room with just me and my guitar. <br>
			<br>
			It wasn't until I came to Berkeley that I got more serious about singing. I joined Artists in Resonance, an a capella group. This group is what motivated me to better myself as a musician. Seeing all the talent at Cal's West Coast Acapella and at UCLA's California Acapella Festival only made me want to get better. This group is without a doubt one of the coolest student groups I've joined at Cal. <br>
			<br>
			With all my music knowledge in piano, guitar, and singing, I like to make covers. I like to say that it's a way for me to monitor my growth as a musician, but honestly it's fun pretending that I'm Ed Sheeran sometimes.
