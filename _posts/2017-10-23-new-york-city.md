### New York City

My dreams of going to New York City were finally fulfilled this past weekend. I went for an interview with Blackrock, but I got to stay the weekend and explore the city. It was an overwhelming experience.

I walked around Midtown the night I landed and was just amazed at all the buildings everywhere. Every street looked the same, and every person looked to be in a rush. I somehow ended up in Time Square with my roommate for the night, and it was better than I imagined. The area literally glowed with light, and even at midnight, there were people laughing, taking pictures, and eating street food. This is probably the liveliest place I've been to in the United States.

The next day was the interview. This really opened my eyes to how much of a difference there is between a Berkeley Computer Science degree compared to other schools. Thank you Berkeley I guess :).

My friends Michel and Anna also came to visit, and we got an Airbnb in Brooklyn. It was good to see a familiar face from home, especially in a foreign place like the East Coast. We ate tons of good food, walked around Chelsea, and watched a improv comedy show at UCB. This was definitely the weekend I needed.

One of the biggest things I wanted to get from this trip was to figure out whether I wanted to stay on the West Coast or go to the East Coast after graduation, and I can confidently say West Coast is the way to go. NYC was fun for a weekend, but I don't think I would be able to live there for an extended period of time. 

Looks like I'll be signing with Airbnb tomorrow, so find me in Seattle!
