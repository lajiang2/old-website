### Council Dinner

Today was the quarterly council dinner, and just like always, planning it and getting everyone together made me want to pull my hair out. But once we got together, it was just like we were back in high school again, being hooligans and stuffing our faces with AYCE korean barbeque at Carbon Grill. I don't know what it is about the council, but no matter how much these guys stress me out, I think we're gonna be friends for a really long time. Maybe we've just been through too much together.

I finally joined AFX this summer. Auditions were horrible, since I just stood there during the audition video, but I'm really glad I auditioned. It's only been three weeks and I already see myself getting a lot better at dancing and being more comfotable with my body. The people are great, practices are fun, and the socials are lit; I honestly couldn't ask for more in a club. I really want to continue this next semester, so I'm going to have to find time for that somewhere in my schedule.

When I was driving Joe home at first, we also had a really long chessy life talk. But even if it was cheesy, I realized a lot by myself. I dip my toe in activities a lot. Spent a semester doing business, a year doing acapella, a summer in photography, just started dancing, and more, but I can't confidently say that I've given my best effort to any one thing.

Even this blog/website is a thing, I was so excited about it for a couple weeks, but after I published it, I haven't touched it. 

I feel like that's not a good quality to have, but it does make me a well-rounded person. I definitly want to be able to say that I've mastered something, anything, before I graduate college. 

That talk I had with Joe motivated me to write this, and I hope it'll lead me to follow my own advice to him: don't be scared to dive.
